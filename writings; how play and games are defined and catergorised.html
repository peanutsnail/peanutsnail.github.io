   <h1>how "play" and "games" are defined and catergorised</h1>
   <h2>a video essay script looking into Huizinga's and Caillois’' philosophies</h2>
    <p>
        Today we’re talking about how the ideas of “play” and “games” are categorised by philosophers Johan Huizinga and Roger Caillois.
        To start, this is an excerpt from Huizinga’s book that we’ll talk about a little later.<br><br>
        “Play is older than culture, as play is defined in nature before man existed.”<br><br>
        This means that humans did not create a play, as animals are seen to play despite their lack of culture.
        Over the years, people have tried to explain play as a “discharge of superabundant vital energy”, “the satisfaction of some imitative instinct” or “a need for relaxation”. However, all these theories rely on the fact that play must have some kind of biological purpose.<br><br>
        Unsatisfied with these explanations, Dutch historian Johan Huizinga outlined play as a result of the creation of an idea he calls the “magic circle” in his 1938 book “Homo Ludens”.<br>
        The magic circle has seven main characteristics that do not revolve around the expectation that play must serve a biological purpose.<br><br>
        <b>These characteristics include play being:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Voluntary; the player should not feel obligated to play.</li>
            <li>Extraordinary; the experience inside the magic circle is separable from the ‘real world’.</li>
            <li>Absorbing; whilst inside the magic circle, necessities of normal life in the ‘real world’ are forgotten.</li>
            <li>Not interested in material gains or profits; players should not leave the magic circle with goods or wealth that can be traded in the ‘real world’.</li>
            <li>Bounded; the magic circle has its own location and duration that it’s bounded by.</li>
            <li>Obedient; players have to abide by certain rules that are only relevant inside the magic circle.</li>
            <li>Promotion of the formation of groups; even after play is over, players can bond beyond the magic circle’s limits.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Caillois’ opposition to Huizinga</h3>
        Much of French philosopher, Roger Caillois’ work was a direct critique of Huizinga’s book, “Homo Ludens”, as he believed that Huizinga “deliberately omit[ed] the description and classification of games themselves.”<br><br>
        Despite Caillois’ harshness, it’s very obvious that many of his ideas in “Man, Play and Games” were built upon Huizinga’s work as there are many similarities between the two’s characteristics of play.<br><br>
        <table style="width:75%">
            <tr>
                <th>Huizinga</th>
                <th>Caillois</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>voluntary</td>
                <td>free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>extraordinary</td>
                <td>make-believe</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>absorbing</td>
                <td>—</td>
            <tr>
                <td>no material gains/profits</td>
                <td>unproductive</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>bounded</td>
                <td>separate</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>obedient</td>
                <td>goverened by rules</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>promotes forming groups</td>
                <td>—</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>—</td>
                <td>uncertain</td>
            </tr>
        </table><br>
        Although, Caillois did include another characteristic, uncertainty, as a player should not be able to know the outcome of a game before it happens.
        <h3>Caillois’ typology of games</h3>
        Other than the characteristics of play, Caillois wanted to create a distinction between what play is and what a game is, as he believed that they are fundamentally different.
        Now, play and games are not mutually exclusive, and Caillois used that to create a scale. On one side there is Paidia — a freeform, improvised and fun experience where “carefree gaiety is dominant”; this is what we would call “play” — and on the other side there is Ludus — a rule-bound and rigid experience driven by competition with “arbitrary ... tedious conventions”; or in other words, a “game”.<br><br>
        When a magic circle becomes established with rules, repeated or shared, play becomes a game.<br><br>
        <table style="width:75%">
            <tr>
                <th>Paidia</th>
                <th>Ludus</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>free-form</td>
                <td>rule-bound</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>improvised</td>
                <td>rigid</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>fun</td>
                <td>competitive</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"carefree gaiety"</td>
                <td>"arbitrary, tedious conventions"</td>
            </tr>
        </table><br>
        Think of Paidia as similar to a sandbox experience like Minecraft where there is no real objective. Yes you can kill the Ender Dragon, but nothing pushes you to pursue that goal, instead, you could build a cabin in the forest, be the owner of your very own farm or create a room to store all your resources; there is no “right” way to play Minecraft.<br><br>
        On the other hand, platform fighters such as MultiVersus are more Ludus-structured experiences. The way you play the game is very limited as your objective is given to you without the player’s input. The only goal is to fight and beat your opponents by hitting them outside of the allocated boundary.
        Even the movement is limited to a character’s abilities and class type. Certain buttons must be pressed in certain orders to enact certain combos, with very little wiggle room for the player to produce actions that were not planned by the developers.<br><br>
        Now, both Minecraft and MultiVersus are great examples of video games that prioritise play or the game; meeting far sides of Caillois’ scale, but to demonstrate how the scale can be used for any game, Terraria is a great example as it meets the criteria for both Paidia and Ludus similarly.<br><br>
        Like Minecraft, Terraria is a sandbox game however, there are more rules and expectations, causing it to lean more towards having a Ludus structure in some aspects. You don’t have to focus on the combat aspect of the game instead, you could make an inn to house all of your NPC friends, but there are factors that try to influence the way you play the game.
        Certain resources are locked behind the progression of defeating certain bosses. Therefore, if a player only wants to focus on building a home base or exploring the world, they are punished due to not prioritising combat, which was intended by the game developers to be a main part of the game.<br><br>
        <b>Caillois created a classification system that divided a game’s main feature into one of four rubrics:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Agôn; competition</li>
            <li>Alea; luck</li>
            <li>Mimicry; role-playing</li>
            <li>Ilinx; intense emotions</li>
        </ol>
        Games are able to fit one, multiple, or all of these rubrics. Hades is a perfect example of this as it highlights aspects of each of these rubrics.
        Hades’ main game loop consists of fighting your way through the levels of hell in hopes of escaping it; with definite competition or Agôn in the combat. Agôn prioritises allowing the player to have their superiority and talent in a game recognised, as fundamentally, the game is coded and created in the same way for every player, but it is the player’s actions that determine their outcome. One player may have faster reflexes and a strong understanding of all the mechanics and intricacies of the game that are at their disposal. This allows them to show that as they know more about the game, they are better than another player with a lesser understanding of the same mechanics.<br><br>
        Alea comes into play through the luck aspects of randomised floors, enemies and boones that you encounter on each playthrough. This part of Hades demonstrates that although a player may be more talented and understand the rules more if they do not receive favourable outcomes in terms of boss movement patterns or specific loot drops, they will be unable to have full control of their success in-game.<br><br>
        Despite Agôn and Alea highlighting opposite characteristics, they share the same law; that pure equal conditions are created in-game that players are denied in real life.<br><br>
        Mimicry is a consistent theme as you play as Hades’ son Zagreus, interacting with other Greek gods who are willing to aid you on your journey of escaping the underworld. Role-playing in a game allows players to become an illusory character. This provides them with the opportunity to momentarily forget or disguise their true personality in favour of another whilst in the magic circle. This is very important in video games as developers commonly aim to provide an ability for the player to escape into both a fictional character and the world that they inhabit. Simple examples of this can be easily seen through when a player states that they died in the game, rather than saying that Zagreus, the protagonist, died in the game.<br><br>
        Agôn and Mimicry share a similarity between the want to be perceived as competent in the game that they are playing. However, this competency is usually shown through the character’s upgrades or tangible evidence of progress within the game world rather than the physical ability of the player to control the character in the real world.<br><br>
        In a fast-paced game like this, intense emotions and ilinx are everywhere; from the frustration of dying on the final floor to the excitement when you manage to beat that boss after numerous failed attempts. Games like Hades keep the player engaged by giving them such a strong sense of emotions that they are enthralled in the game world. This follows back to Huizinga’s characteristics of play, as whilst inside the magic circle, the experience of playing Hades is extraordinary and separable from the ‘real world’.<br><br>
        And with that, this about wraps up this video essay, I hope you now have a better understanding of both the similarities and differences between the definitions of “play” and “games”. As well as now having the ability to be able to identify aspects of games and the distinctions of the four rubrics of Agôn, Alea, Mimicry and Ilinx.
