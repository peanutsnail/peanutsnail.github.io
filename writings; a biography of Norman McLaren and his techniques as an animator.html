   <h1>a biography of Norman McLaren and his techniques as an animator</h1>
    <p>
        Born in Stirling, Scotland on April 11, 1914, William Norman McLaren (Norman McLaren) was destined to be one of animation’s greatest pioneers, unbeknownst to parents William and Jean McLaren at the time.<br><br>
        Growing up as the youngest, McLaren’s first introduction to animation was through cartoons such as Felix the Cat and Mickey Mouse at the age of seven (Sharman, 2019). Despite his creative talent in drawing and painting (Figure 1.), the art of animation did not interest him until his teenage years when he discovered Soviet filmmakers Vsevolod Pudovkin and Sergei Eisenstein.

    <p>
        Both Pudovkin and Eisenstein produced multiple films that were grounded by their own ‘montage theory’ by prioritising the connection of different shots, allowing for complex ideas to be portrayed when played back altogether (Pudovkin, 1949/2006). This technique would later be used in McLaren’s 1952 animation ‘Neighbours’, editing shots together to allow for a deeper understanding of the scene rather than just the contents of the shot alone.<br><br>
        After high school in 1932, McLaren enrolled in the Glasgow School of Art to study interior design due to his father being an interior designer. Although, during his first year, he started making animation films with used 35mm film to save money (Folkart, 1987). McLaren’s film ‘Color Cocktail’ won an award at the Scottish Amateur Film Festival, presented to him by the head of the UK General Post Office (GPO) film unit, John Grierson. This success led Grierson to hire McLaren where he then worked from 1936 to 1939, making eight films.<br><br>
        The ability to work with talents such as Len Lye, Basil Wright and Lotte Reiniger skyrocketed McLaren’s career and notoriety in the animation and filmmaking worlds. In 1941, Grierson asked McLaren to join him at the National Film Board (NFB) in Canada where he would then recruit art students, known as Studio A. During his time at the NFB, McLaren made around 70 films.<br><br>
        Throughout his career, McLaren strived to produce a number of films with vastly different experimental techniques with inspiration from his friends and colleagues. One of these colleagues was New Zealand animator Len Lye who, rather than using a camera, would paint and scratch directly onto the film stock (Lye, 1958) as well as pixilation and stencil animation (Lye, 1936). These animation techniques would also be seen in McLaren’s works, as he would continuously innovate until his retirement in 1984.

    <h3>‘<em>Begone Dull Care</em>’ (1949)</h3>
    <p>
        Directed by McLaren and film student Evelyn Lambart, Oscar-nominated ‘<em>Begone Dull Care</em>’ features abstract, modernist shapes and forms which are synchronised to jazz’s Oscar Peterson Trio.<br><br>
        This piece was made unconventionally, as instead of scratching images onto the film stick frame by frame, McLaren and Lambart took the liberty of ignoring the frame divisions entirely by painting across whole lengths of film (Dobson, 2014). This technique of disregarding a camera and creating animation directly on the film stock was something that McLaren had done over a decade before whilst still in university, where he would wash off the emulsion from a reel and paint directly onto it.<br><br>
        Due to the music being composed and recorded first, McLaren and Lambart allowed the sounds to define the movements that took place within the animation, The improvisatory nature of jazz was used to create a three-part film that created a satisfying relationship between sound and visuals.<br><br>
        A technique used in this piece is in regards to the way McLaren characterised specific sounds, as each instrument has its own specific background or pattern attributed to it. For example, the cello is characterised by imprinted shapes on a moving red background, while the piano creates shapes and lines that move in time across the screen (Williams, 2010).<br><br>
        What I enjoy most about this film is the way in which McLaren uses layers to present multiple swatches of colour in one frame. I also enjoy the shift between the Trio’s light-hearted and upbeat music to a slower tune before returning once again to fast-paced; it keeps the almost eight-minute-long film dynamic and consistently refreshing.
    </p>   
    <h3>‘<em>Neighbours</em>’ (1952)</h3>
    <p>
        McLaren’s personal favourite film featured Grant Munro and Jean-Paul Ladouceur, who were enlisted by McLaren to help him create films while they were still in university a decade prior. This film won an Academy Award in 1953 for “Best Documentary, Short Subjects” despite it not being of that kind, creating strong discourse throughout film critiques at the time.<br><br>
        The most famous technique used in this film is pixilation; a stop-motion animation technique where McLaren used humans, instead of puppets, who moved between each shot, editing them together instead of filming. This can mostly be shown in the scene of the neighbours creating their fence as well as when they are sliding along the grass. Another technique used is McLaren’s ability to create sounds and effects by photographing cards inscribed with sound-wave patterns for 60 notes on a chromatic scale onto the film stock.<br><br>
        Out of the three films analysed in this piece, ‘<em>Neighbours</em>’ is my favourite; between the men’s child-like movements juxtaposed against the outlandish violence of this anti-military piece, and the pastel colours captured by the 16mm Kodachrome film at the time, this animation is one that I am extremely drawn to.

    <h3>‘<em>Blinkity Blank</em>’ (1955)</h3>
    <p>
        Films as abstract as BAFTA-winning ‘<em>Blinkity Blank</em>’ were extremely common for McLaren, as they allowed him to focus on the experimental design techniques of animation rather than being expected to have it make sense in our ordinary world bound by ‘realistic’ rules. This film was made by scratching directly on black emulsion-coated film and colouring his subjects with transparent dyes.<br><br>
        After he scratched the film stock, he cut the imagery spasmodically in order to see how much ‘after-image’ the eye’s retina can recall despite the individual frame being shown for only a 48th of a second. Due to the persistence of vision, the image is able to be retained in the audience’s mind for seconds longer than the original before a new image is presented (McLaren & Blackburn, 1955b).<br><br>
        Another animation technique McLaren used was engraving two or more adjacent frames (frame-cluster), if these clusters presented an extended image when played back at a normal speed, specific actions and movements would be emphasised.<br><br>
        I admire this piece more every time I watch it. I like that certain objects and characters have recurring features within the film and as they are made of such unique shapes, they are able to be coloured differently in each frame while still maintaining a cohesive role and overall look. I find both the orchestral music and McLaren’s beats soothing to listen to while also providing more depth. This is prominent when McLaren’s percussion interacts with the orchestra by reproducing the same melody as the woodwind instruments.

    <h3>the importance McLaren placed on sound and his various techniques</h3>
    <p>
        When asked how he would want to be remembered in 100 years, Norman McLaren replied: “I might be classed as an animated filmmaker or maybe there is a little subclass called the experimental filmmaker, in which I would prefer to be classed.” (Wise, n.d.). This quote highlights the way in which McLaren cared not just for visual animation and storytelling, but other aspects of the final product such as sound design. This has been shown throughout his entire career, as he consistently favoured an abstract style to allow music and sound to guide the movements of subjects in his animations.<br><br>
        McLaren pioneered the use of graphical sound through pen-point percussion as well as non-auditory techniques such as pixilation and drawn-on-film animation. When applying multiple of these techniques simultaneously, McLaren was able to create a satisfying relationship between sound and visuals, allowing the music to conduct the visual’s storytelling and ultimately solidifying him as one of the greatest experimental filmmakers in history.
