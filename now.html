            I’m currently studying a Bachelor of Games and Interactivity and a Bachelor of Animation 
            at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.
            It's summer break and other than working, I plan to focus on my own projects
            to both build up a portfolio and practice skills I feel I’m less strong at.<br><br>
            <b>My goals this break are to:</b><br>
            - continue to grow my website’s content and ecosystem<br>
            - create a game using twine and upload it to <a href="https://mil0s.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a><br>
            - practice my drawing skills with a focus on anatomy, observational sketching and maybe character design<br>
            - build a pc in order to be able to work more efficiently with the tools I need from home<br>
            - start illustrating and conceptualising a huge world-building project<br>
