  <p>
    This is a page documenting what I'm currently working on and doing.<br>
    This practice is thanks to Derek Sivers' <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">/now page</a> movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's summer break and other than working, I plan to focus on my own projects
    to both build up a portfolio and practice skills I feel I’m less strong at.<br><br>
    <b>My goals this break are to:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>continue to grow my website’s content and ecosystem</li>
      <li>create a game using twine and upload it to <a href="https://peanutsnail.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a></li>
      <li>practice my drawing skills with a focus on anatomy, observational sketching and maybe character design</li>
      <li>build a pc in order to be able to work more efficiently with the tools I need from home</li>
      <li>start illustrating and conceptualising a huge world-building project</li>
    </ul>
