   <h1>the history of love, loss and grief in animation</h1>
   <h2>a selective curation of the history of animation</h2>
    <h3>curator’s introduction</h3>
    <p>
        In this curated program, eight short films will be shown that best highlight the themed history of love, loss and grief in animation. With many different overarching genres, these films include the demonstration of love in relationships, including but not limited to, storge (familial), eros (sexual) and philautia (self). In multiple cases, this love often is fractured in some way, resulting in the loss of one’s self, another or their innocence. The grief experienced by loss comes in many forms, some of which are healthier than others. However, regardless of if it is quiet or more pronounced, the anguish felt by many of the characters within these films is a perfect depiction of humanity’s capacity to assimilate such potent emotions into their understanding of the world.<br><br>
        From these films, ranging from 1984 to as recent as last year, there are multiple shared styles and techniques used to convey a more candid and authentic narrative. Animations with the themes of love, loss and grief are commonly hand-drawn, allowing the animator to have more intimate control over the story they are telling. In these shorts, the dialogue is either that of narration and interviews or nonexistent, as characters on screen often represent meanings or lives off screen often represent an individual greater than the one portrayed on screen. Therefore, as there is regularly no spoken audio, sound design and musical compositions are heavily relied on to form the overall feel of their respective piece.

    <h3>‘<em>Jumping</em>’ (1984)</h3>
    <p>   
        Manga artist and animator, Osamu Tezuka, is best known for the ‘<em>Astro Boy</em>’ and ‘<em>Phoenix</em>’ series, however, he is also loved by a devoted group for his more experimental films. Tezuka is referred to as the “Godfather of Manga” for his contribution to multiple visual storytelling mediums, pioneered techniques and redefinition of genres.<br><br>
        His early influences include Walt Disney’s films, which would lead him to draw his own comics in elementary school, and the Chinese animation ‘<em>Princess Iron Fan</em>’. More specifically, for his thirteenth experimental film ‘<em>Jumping</em>’, he was inspired by Hungarian animator, Ferenc Rofusz’s ‘<em>The Fly</em>’ (1980) as a way to convey a first-person view of the world through a child’s eyes. <br><br>   
        ‘<em>Jumping</em>’ features a young boy jumping down a street before being able to jump further and further away from his hometown and into a city, ocean and eventually a war-ridden country. As he moves further away from what he knows, he is faced with the realisation of the state of the world, ultimately losing his innocence to the truth of man’s destruction.<br><br>    
        I commend the metaphor in this short, with jumping not just being that of a physical movement, but an action deliberately taken and a movement through time. This film serves as a criticism of humanity, with Tezuka reminding us that “we humans have a tendency to go too far with what we do. Often this becomes either a dilemma or catastrophe.”

    <h3>‘<em>Uncle</em>’ (1996)</h3>
    <p>
        ‘<em>Uncle</em>’ was Australian animator, Adam Elliot’s, first film. It was a student film created whilst he was specialising in animation at the Victorian College of the Arts under guidance from Ann Shenfield, Robert Stephenson and Sarah Watt. Inspired by Stephenson’s claymation films such as ‘<em>Still Flying</em>’ (1988), Elliot used the same techniques; recording his stop-motion animation with a 16mm Bolex camera and editing it on a Steenbeck. Despite many highlighting similarities between Elliot’s animations and ‘Wallace and Gromit’, he says that he is “grateful to companies like Aardman [Animations] who’ve brought claymation to the masses, but think[s he’d] still be a stop-motion animator regardless of whether [the series was] invented.”<br><br>
        Unhappy with the label of “claymator,” he defines his work as “clayography,” with all his pieces being clay-animated biographies loosely based on his family and friends. All of Elliot’s films have a melancholic feel to them, with all his characters living with affliction. The sombre approach taken through the use of the mild-toned narrator William McInnes and the colourless film has demonstrated that mediums, such as clay, that are primarily associated with children’s animation are able to be used to tell a more mature story to an adult audience, as at the time, the connotations of animation geared towards adults heavily implied the genre of pornography.<br><br>
        Elliot also created somewhat of a movement by covering issues of social impairments, physical disabilities and mental illnesses in a way in which instead of trivialising the character’s struggles, dark humour is used to make the character’s situation feel more bitter.<br><br>
        I liked this film due to the ennui recollection of the Uncle’s life being both simplistic and not overly dramatic. This, along with the melancholy narration, made it all the more sincere. As someone who loved claymation such as ‘Wallace and Gromit’ growing up, it was almost nostalgic to watch the same medium being used to tell a more mature story; something I can watch now, being older, and appreciate, just as I did for ‘Wallace and Gromit’ when I was younger.

    <h3>‘<em>His Mother's Voice</em>’ (1997)</h3>
    <p>
        Australian animator Dennis Tupicoff has made a name for himself with the unique visual style seen in many of his animated documentaries such as ‘<em>Darra Dogs</em>’, ‘<em>Chainsaw</em>’ and ‘<em>His Mother’s Voice</em>’ which won Best Animated Film at the Melbourne Film Festival in 1997.<br><br>
        Animation documentaries form a genre of animation first contributed to by Winsor McCay in 1918, with his depiction of a British ocean liner sunk by a German submarine, appropriately named ‘<em>The Sinking of the Lusitania</em>’.<br><br>
        Following ‘<em>His Mother’s Voice</em>’, films with a similar format have been created, an example being James Blagden’s 2009 ‘<em>Dock Ellis & the LSD No-No</em>’. This features a voice-over interview with pitcher Dock Ellis recounting how he threw the only no-hitter of his career, whilst on acid, with hand-drawn animation used as the visual medium of his retelling.<br><br>
        ‘<em>His Mother’s Voice</em>’ follows mother Kathy Easdale’s recollection of the night that she found out her sixteen-year-old son, Matthew Easdale, was shot dead in a Brisbane house. Tupicoff’s animation is accompanied by the interview conducted by Matt Brown for ABC Radio several weeks after the incident.<br><br>
        The film uses 35mm rotoscoped footage of the events of the night, including Mrs. Easdale walking up to the house that Matthew was in and police officers delivering the awful news.<br><br>
        Then it starts again, this time the same narration is played, but with rotoscoped footage of Mrs. Easdale’s house drawn with charcoal. This is uncommon in animation — playing the same audio twice with a new visual perspective — but it is perfectly consistent with how she would likely be reliving the event over and over. Even if the audience was to take in the film a thousand times the pain and disorientation could never amount to that experience by Mrs. Easdale as she lost both sons; the body of one and the soul of the other.<br><br>
        Within this unit, no other film has come close to having been held in my mind as much as this one. The music by Burkhard Dallwitz creates a dream-like and almost surreal atmosphere that reflects the complex emotions of the situation perfectly. The grief that Mrs. Easdale is experiencing is likely to still cause her to be in shock and denial, cementing the idea of being in a dream-like state; expecting to wake up from this nightmare and see her beloved son alive and well. The vibrant yet dull colours, the line-work of the reenactment of the event, and the charcoal’s honesty in depicting Mrs. Easdale’s eyes have never made me feel more empathetic towards another person, much less a person whom I do not know.

    <h3>‘<em>Bermuda</em>’ (1998)</h3>
    <p>
        Ülo Pikkov is an Estonian animator who got his start working at Eesti Joonisfilm, an independent studio formed by drawn-animation filmmakers by the likes of Priit Pärn and Mati Kütt. Pikkov’s drawing style shares a striking similarity to not only his mentor, Pärn’s, but to Estonian animation as a whole; having a distinct and shared cultural identity. I appreciate the films of this bygone era as they were shrouded in political doublespeak and explored the fundamentals of human existence; fears and desires.<br><br>
        Pikkov’s award-winning student animation ‘Bermuda’ tells a story of a love triangle between a sailor, mermaid and centaur. Similar to Gonzalez’s recent film ‘Ice Merchants’, the character’s daily routine is established to be the basis of the sailor and mermaid’s relationship. In a desolate landscape, the mermaid relies on the sailor to bring her water every day. Despite the monotonous task, the sailor loves the mermaid and yells at the sky to keep the rainclouds away so as to be allowed to continue to care for her; fearing a future without her. Eventually, when rain beings to fall, the sailor is abandoned and betrayed by his love for the ill-fated centaur. Although the water rises and his old sense of self should return, his codependency on the mermaid has led him to lose his own identity.<br><br>
        Over the past twenty-seven years, Pikkov has produced a highly renowned body of work that spans past his ever-growing filmography to fiction writings for children and adults as well as scholarly articles regarding animation theory. Currently, he is the chairman of the Estonian Filmmakers Association board and supports upcoming and established animators to receive funding for their films.

    <h3>‘<em>Ryan</em>’ (2004)</h3>
    <p>
        CGI animator Chris Landreth’s Oscar-winning computer-animated film ‘<em>Ryan</em>’ is a biography of former NFB animator Ryan Larkin who lived on skid row in Montreal. However, despite the intention of this film to be about Ryan’s life and slow decline into cocaine and alcohol addiction to battle his loss of creativity, what is more on display is the relationship between both him and Chris.<br><br>
        Seeing Ryan’s decline as similar to his own mother Barbara’s, Chris asks Ryan if he could try to beat his alcohol addiction. When the fear of failure is acknowledged by either of them, colourful threads bind their head, blinding them. This was animated using algorithms created by the University of Toronto’s Mathematics Department. The use of algorithms in animation was not uncommon at the time, however, it was mostly used by corporations such as Disney and Pixar to realistically animate textures in films such as ‘<em>Toy Story</em>’ and ‘<em>Monsters, Inc.</em>’, not independent filmmakers or small studios.<br><br>
        The characters in the film were inspired partially by Body Worlds, an exhibition of human bodies’ internal anatomical structures preserved by plastination. The visceral style of Landreth’s work has been defined as “psycho realism”; using photorealism to portray emotion and internal realities visually, and has been used since in his 2010 film ‘<em>An Eyeful of Sound</em>’.<br><br>
        Following the success of the film, Larkin was asked to work on a film ‘<em>Spare Change</em>’ with Laurie Gordon, this allowed the world to see more of Ryan Larkin’s genius not long before his death in 2007.<br><br>
        What stood out to me is the symbolic nature of the character’s themselves. The loss and struggles felt by both Ryan and Chris are visualised through the incompleteness of their face, head and bodies. In the opening of the film, Chris explains when his scars formed, whereas Ryan does not have scars. Instead, he is missing entire portions of his head; hollowed out by his self-destructive impulses and permanently removing his sense of self. Ryan’s lack of identity, degradation, loss of power and personal failure are all shown through the deranged animation as he believed that “one cannot do anything, anything at all without the power of money”. This is an important sentiment, as it shows first-hand how passion and devotion cannot sustain one’s self.

    <h3>‘<em>J'aime Les Filles</em>’ (2016)</h3>
    <p>
        Diane Obomsawin focuses on exploring the naïvety and honesty of lesbian first love in her piece ‘<em>J'aime Les Filles</em>’, translated to ‘<em>I Like Girls</em>’. This short film was adapted by the National Film Board from her 2014 graphic novel of the same name and focuses on four women’s memories of discovering their sexual identity.<br><br>
        The unique and simple colour-blocked art style with half-human-half-animal characters allows the film to be accessible to all audiences and prioritises the recollection of the stories over the visuals. Obomsawin also notes that animal motifs were used to depict the animalistic side of human beings as a part of nature.<br><br>
        Inspired after hearing Quebec novelist Michel Tremblay’s realisation that he was gay when he was sixteen, Obomsawin recalled her friends having similar stories and asked them “What’s the first memory you have of you being attracted to a woman?” When animating these stories, she felt it was important to depict them having a sex life. This was done by tracing Renaissance paintings to form her character’s interactions as it made them more sensual as well as rotoscoping actors, a technique pioneered by the Fleischer brothers.<br><br>
        Due to the unjust representation of lesbians in cinema, Obomsawin decided to celebrate them without the stereotypical lesbian protagonist whose ill fate was determined by a heteronormative man. The goal of this film is to represent women and female homosexuality in an authentic way, resulting in opposing the taboo topic.<br><br>
        This piece stood out to me due to just how candid and definite each story was. With each vignette, I found myself thinking back to my first experience realising I was in love with a girl and how innocent and sincere first love is. Obomsawin did not prioritise dramatic retellings, and yet they were all extremely vivid in detail and unambiguously described the way in which these women felt without relying on complicated animation.

    <h3>‘<em>The Flying Sailor</em>’ (2022)</h3>
    <p>
        Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis are a Canadian animation duo who are based out of Calgary. The pair met in Vancouver whilst studying at the Emily Carr University of Art and have since gone on to work at the National Film Board, creating films such as 1999 Palme d'Or winner ‘<em>When the Day Breaks</em>’.<br><br>
        Forbis and Tilby have cemented their place in film history as recognised by receiving ASIFA’s Winsor McCay Award in 2017 for their “exceptional contribution to the art of animation”. This is one of the highest honours that can be given to an animator, placing their names among greats such as Max and Dave Fleischer, Tim Burton, Chuck Jones and Walt Disney who have also received the award.<br><br>
        Inspired by the story of Charlie Mayers, a sailor who survived being thrown over two kilometres by the 1917 Halifax explosion, Tilby and Forbis were fascinated by the way in which he had been in flight and aimed to convey the philosophical and profound experience in ‘<em>The Flying Sailor</em>’.<br><br>
        This piece focuses on the contemplation of the wonder and fragility of existence; as once placed in a near-death experience, the world strips us bare and changes our perspective on our utterly insignificant mortality. To me, the grief and acceptance of this fate are almost palpable, as the short moves us through flashes of the sailor’s life accompanied by his balletic movements underscored by Luigi Allemano’s composition.

    <h3>‘<em>Ice Merchants</em>’ (2022)</h3>
    <p>
        João Gonzalez is a Portuguese film director, animator, illustrator and trained classical pianist. Prior to Ice Merchants, Gonzalez created two films: his first film and final student project at ESMAD ‘<em>The Voyager</em>‘ (2017) and his Master’s film ‘<em>Nestor</em>’ (2019) which was completed whilst studying at the Royal College of Art. Both of these were highly successful films, winning many awards such as Best Student Film and António Gaio Award at CINANIMA respectively.<br><br>
        ‘<em>Ice Merchants</em>’ follows a father and son whose daily routine of making ice, parachuting from their home on a mountain to sell ice before buying new hats and coming home tells a story of family connection and simple daily routines and rituals that build the foundation of human relationships.<br><br>
        The loneliness and solitude of this mountain home are only deeper engrained with the distant, melancholic atmosphere produced by the sound design. The four distinct musical pieces played mostly by a string ensemble of no more than six musicians allow for a delicate and ethereal sound that resonates with me due to its simple and honest nature.<br><br>
        ‘<em>Ice Merchants</em>’ historically is the first Portuguese animation to be awarded at the Cannes Film Festival, premiering at the 2022 International Critics’ Week. It also is the first Portuguese production to receive an Academy Award nomination.<br><br>
        Although Gonzalez has not stated any specific source of inspiration for his film, he is fascinated with the freedom animation allows. Scenarios that are never possible in our reality are commonplace in films such as his, allowing for a more metaphorical world to be built.
