   <h1>Don’t Worry Darling (2022)—the cover-up scene</h1>
   <h2>a close-scene analysis</h2>
    <p>
        <b><em>CONTENT WARNING: mentioning of a suicidal act (second sentence in the introduction)</em></b><br><br>
        Olivia Wilde’s 2022 psychological thriller ‘<em>Don’t Worry Darling</em>’ (Wilde, 2022), depicts young wife, Alice Cambers’ (Florence Pugh), suspicion, paranoia and rejection of her daily routine and community within the idyllic 1950s American suburb of Victory. This scene follows the events of neighbour Margaret’s (KiKi Layne) psychological and physical deterioration, reaching a climax for both Alice and the audience when Margaret slits her throat and falls to her death before being whisked away by Victory workers and appearing alive later on. Wilde uses established Western cinematographic conventions to communicate Alice’s denunciation of societal expectations and fake ‘truths’. Alice is portrayed as a feminist who rebels against the patriarchal status quo in her relationship with her husband, Jack (Harry Styles), and authority through resistant interactions between the characters and their contrasting colour compositions. As commonplace in the thriller and horror genres, typical editing and cinematographic practices are used to elicit emotions of suspense, thrill and neurosis within the audience, sharing the emotional state of Alice during the scene.<br><br>
        Through the use of angled shots and other cinematographic conventions, Wilde presents Alice as an independent and free-thinking woman who challenges the validity of what she is told by authority. When Dr. Collins (Timothy Simons) returns to retrieve his briefcase, a low-angle medium-long shot is used to look up at him. Dr. Collins is both physically taller than Alice due to the living room’s lower height and the camera’s upwards-pointing angle. Wilde uses this to create the impression that he towers over her, making him look powerful (Spadoni, 2014) as he is at a superior vantage point; knowing what happened to Margaret and having the ability to conceal the truth from Alice.<br>
        <span class="tab"></span>Due to Dr. Collins’ taller appearance, when Alice hands Dr. Collins the briefcase, the audience may subconsciously expect her to be pictured in an upward-angle shot. However, this is not the case, as Wilde’s straight-on medium shot highlights that although Alice is not aware of the truth, she does not believe Dr. Collins’ explanation of events and therefore has reclaimed a small amount of power over the situation. The anticipated high-angle shot of Alice would have presented her in a “diminutive and vulnerable” way (Spadoni, 2014, p.106). Wilde’s lack of this cinematographic custom breaks the male-gaze convention; allowing the audience to view Alice as more than a passive object that lacks agency over her own thoughts and beliefs (Mulvey, 1975/1989).<br>
        <span class="tab"></span>When questioning Dr. Collins on how Margaret is okay after the incident, he describes that “[Margaret] needed quite a bit of help, not like [Alice].” When cutting to Alice’s reaction to this comment, Wilde adopts the ‘Kubrick Stare’ a well-known cinematographic technique in which the subject’s head is titled down whilst they look up beneath their eyebrows. Commonly, this method is used to invoke a sense of unease, threat and feeling of being witnessed in the audience (Williams, 2020). However, when paired with the fact that Wilde consistently presents Alice as the protagonist and Victory’s authority figures, such as Dr. Collins, as antagonists, it is not the audience that should feel unsettled, it is him. Paired with her smile, Wilde highlights Alice’s cleverness; she is secretly aware of Dr. Collin’s deceit and therefore demonstrates dominance over her belief systems and her contempt of authoritarian propaganda. Wilde’s use of Kubrick’s stylistic technique defies its regular intention, as the Stare is frequently used to allow characters to “look beyond the screen boundary into the audience space” (Melia, 2018, p.200), ultimately breaking the fourth wall. Although, in this instance, Wilde does not allow Alice’s look to escape the world of the film as the close-up shot is not held for an uncomfortably long period of time and it is also contextualised as Alice’s response to Dr. Collins’ statement. With these Western cinematographic conventions, Wilde attempts to overcome misogynistic formalities expected from the audience through Alice’s ability to retain a sense of power over her situation and beliefs.<br><br>
        Wilde uses Alice’s superficial actions, informal costuming and colour compositions of characters to subvert traditional gender roles expected of women in the 1950s era and depict the relationship breakdown between Jack and Alice. Pugh and Styles’ performance, through the actors’ body movements, physical gestures and eye contact, suggest their attitudes towards each other (Corrigan & White, 2012, p.74). As customary of women of that era, Alice is expected to ‘see out’ her husband and guest once their conversation is over. However, Alice neither walks them to the door nor says “goodbye”. Once Jack returns, Alice remains straight-faced while not reciprocating Jack’s hug or eye contact. This cold and distant body language emphasises her disdain for him and undermines her conventional role as a wife; with women in martial relationships being rarely allowed to display discontentment with their partner.<br>
        <span class="tab"></span>Alice is pictured wearing a dressing gown with her hair down during this scene. In the 1950s, this lack of formality is abnormal for a woman due to the expectation for her to be dressed in day clothes with her hair ‘done up’. Wilde’s costuming choice highlights Alice’s lack of respect for Dr. Collins as both a guest and an authority figure as she is shown to not put effort into her ‘presentability’.<br>
        <span class="tab"></span>Alice’s informality is more apparent when juxtaposed with both Dr. Collins’ and Jack’s attire; suits and business shoes. Jack’s olive-coloured suit shares a more similar colour palette to Dr. Collins’ dark grey suit than Alice’s floral teal gown. The men’s darker suits subtly highlight their antagonistic motives to the audience (p.78). With the lack of cohesion between Jack and Alice’s costuming—in both formal/informal and dark/light—Wilde presents the relationship between the two characters as divergent and therefore strained. Presenting Alice as an individual within her apathetic marriage, Wilde allows women spectators to identify with a female protagonist that is not a passive object who is there only to be looked at (Oliver, 2017). By showing her unhappiness with Jack, Alice demonstrates agency within her relationship, perverting the patriarchal expectations of 1950s wives.<br><br>
        Typical cinematic techniques along with the architecture of the setting are used to evoke a sense of anxiety, insecurity and unease within the audience, as expected of the thriller genre. A thriller’s purpose is to “pull the viewer into the protagonist’s situation and point of view” (Selbo, 2014, p.203). Wilde achieves this through rapid cuts between Alice and Dr. Collins during their conversation. The lack of rhythm between cuts creates anticipation in the audience, building energy that is not released immediately (Pearlman, 2016), creating awareness in the audience that Alice is “constantly at risk; [facing] high stakes, plot complications and danger” (Selbo, 2014, p.203).<br>
        <span class="tab"></span>When Alice looks at Margaret’s file, the camera follows Alice walking around the room, circling her. By quickly moving around Alice in an unstable manner, the viewer’s physical disorientation conveys the psychological disorientation of Alice (Lash, 2020) as she does not know to what extent she is being deceived, with the file lacking an explanation.<br>
        <span class="tab"></span>Whilst she is doing this, the film set’s 1950s mid-century modern architecture creates tension through the subconscious feeling that Alice may be being surveilled. Like Victory, the living room in which this scene takes place is deceptively serene; large floor-to-ceiling windows allow for sunlight to enter the house, providing a bright and cheerful atmosphere on the surface. However, the windows also create a sense of exploitation and invasion of privacy in Alice’s home (Ciccognani, 2022); allowing anyone to pry on her seditious actions, thus ultimately creating a shared sense of paranoia between Alice and the audience.<br><br>
        In conclusion, the cinematography within Olivia Wilde’s ‘<em>Don’t Worry Darling</em>’ frames the character of Alice as a determined woman whose actions reject Victory’s tyrannical, patriarchal institution and the oppressive systems of thinking that prioritise the denial of cognitive dissonance. Her autonomy is presented by Wilde through her disputation of propaganda and lies stated by Dr. Collins through the colour compositions, costuming and acting observed within the scene. Wilde adheres to conventions of the thriller genre, creating a deeper sense of turmoil that is felt by both Alice and the audience through the use of the editing's inconsistent timings, quick twisting camera movements and specific set design.
