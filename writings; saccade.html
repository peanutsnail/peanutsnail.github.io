        A sudden drop. A moment in free fall before the front of the tractor flipped, overturned to the cloudless sky.
        A minute passed before I realised what had happened. Then a jolt, like a lightning strike, ran through my back.<br>
        <br>
        I lay there for what felt like years, using every ounce of energy to keep my breathing steady.
        The sun's rays sting my eyes as I try to shift my head into the safety of the tractor's shade.
        My stomach dropped when I heard Sarah's car come up the dirt road.
        The quiet rumble of the engine with the occasional thus of the front bumper as it hit the potholes I swore to her I would fill.
        Just another example of me padding her life with false hope and empty promises.

        The day I had married her, my vows told to her beaming face, particularly hidden behind a hastily arranged bouquet of flowers only cut from Old George's garden hours before.
        Oblivious to the discoloured, flaking paint or the damp smell of the carpet that covered the church's reception floor, she stood patiently waiting for a glimpse of reassurance from me.
        Her deep brown eyes caught the beams of sunlight that flowed through the glass-stained windows, turning them honey.
        I fumbled with the delicate golden band as I lifted her hand, allowing it to drop onto her finger.
        Being too big, she closed her hand, ensuring it didn't fall off.
        Passive glances from her mother and father managed to travel from the back of the room as awkward coughs were almost covered by the sounds of the untuned piano.<br>
        <br>
        The farm life was a simple one, suitable if it were filled with a loving family.
        Children running through paddocks and blissfully chasing cattle, like a game of tag with only one willing participant.
        Sticky hands and bruised knees held and kissed as Sarah would bring out fresh orange juice, picked by the boys from the orchard next door.
        Maybe Sarah would've dressed up our daughter in plaid-patterned dresses, brained her hair with golden ribbon, sending her off with her older brothers knowing of the grass stains she would need to clean later.
        I would teach the boys about hard work; making it a habit to wake up at 5:00 a.m. to milk the cows, helping one another get their daily chores done before school.<br>
    </p>

        A shriek is carried by the wind — louder than the tractor's engine.
        It cuts through the quiet afternoon like a hot knife through butter.
        The rhythmic pounding of feet on hard, dry earth pulsates through my lifeless body.
        I tense as I realise the state in which she would find me; still, bloody, battered, weak.<br>
        <br>
        'Frank.' Sarah's face red from running.<br>
        'Turn it off.' I rasp, unable to crane my neck to face her.<br>
        As she crawls into the upended cabin, awkwardly reaching for the keys; 'Phone.'<br>
        Snapping out of a dazed state, she looks at me for a second. Then off she goes. At a fleeting pace, back to the house.<br>
        <br>
        The sun's harsh rays begin to align with the fine shards of glass scattered across the ground into my eyes.
        As Sarah returns, she catches her breath as she kneels down beside me.
        I see the dry soil begin to mix with the blood of the cuts on the soles of her bare feet.
        Unphased by this, her hand, soft and subtle, falls to rest on my cheek.
        Through her eyes, I see the apprehension, the worry.
        Pulling her hand to wipe her watering eyes, she reveals her palms to be covered in crimson.<br>
    </p>

        The quiet rumble of the Subaru's engine filled the silence between us.
        Sarah couldn't bring herself to cut in the passenger seat, let alone look at anything other than the vast expanse of fields that flew past the window on the way home.
        Peering through the rear-view mirror, I saw her blank, expressionless stare.
        Her thoughts hidden behind hollow eyes.
        Every now and again, sniffles could be heard from the back seat — so quiet they were almost muffled by the sounds of the radiator.<br>
        <br>
        She wouldn't be able to bear it, the caring yet insincere looks from the members in town.
        She's never needed the attention, always satisfied with being only an afterthought.
        A charming yet quiet girl, she wouldn't cope with the shame if they knew.
        <br>
        'We're putting this behind us,' I said in the most affirmative tone I could manage.
        A small nod of acceptance is all she could muster — an agreement to uphold the little presence we had in town.<br>
    </p>

        With her breath almost returning to normal, a tear breaks away from her eye, like a leak in a dam.
        Watching the crystal clear drop roll down her cheek, a sharp twinge of guilt hit me.
        Much like the abrupt plummet you find yourself in when miscalculating the number of stairs in the dark.
        A sinking feeling so sudden that the conclusion of the whole ordeal occurs before you're able to process it.
        Managing to shift the heavy weight of my head upwards, our eyes meet.<br>
        <br>
        'You'll be okay,' she says in a quiet, comforting whisper 'the ambulance is on its way.'<br>
        <br>
        And for the first time in forever, I realise just how beautiful those deep chocolate eyes are.<br>
